## ðŸ›  Core Blockchain & CORE Integration

Fractionax is deployed on **Core Testnet2** (and can easily migrate to Mainnet).  
Our smart contracts handle:
1. **Asset Tokenization** â€” Converting real-world assets into ERC-20/721/1155 tokens.
2. **Fraction Issuance** â€” Splitting ownership into divisible units.
3. **Transaction Processing** â€” Secure buy/sell interactions on-chain.
4. **Ownership Tracking** â€” Immutable records linked to wallet addresses.

**Core Wallet Integration:**
- Users connect via **Core Wallet** or **Metamask** (configured for Core Network).
- All asset purchases and sales are confirmed on-chain.
